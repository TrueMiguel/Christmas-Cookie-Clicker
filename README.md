## Description

#### Elevator Pitch:

Are you a Web Developer? Are you tired? Do you work remote or are you on a computer 24/7 and need a little distraction from the everyday grind?
If code has got you down and you've been craving something sweet to bring you up, then look no further!
Welcome to "CHRISTMAS-COOKIE-CLICKER!"  This Holiday season we're bringing you cookies! That's write, COOKIES!  And I don't mean the kind that store user data, 
there are no puns here.  Cookies so good they jump right off your monitor and into your face!  We got all the favorites, Gingerbread, Gingersnap House, and 
don't forget about everyones favorite redundancy, the classic Sugar Cookie.  So jump in here, these cookies ain't gonna click themselves; besides, 
it's better than that 9am conference call headed by Karen that you normally sleep through.  

Christmas Cookie Clicker Tycoon is a game where the user only needs to click on a cookie.  
The premise of the game is short and simple but addictive: players click on a big cookie to generate points. As you accumulate said points, you can unlock new upgrades, like other cookies that increase the amount of points per  click you, the user, receives.  The more points you earn, the faster you can progress through the game, unlocking new features and challenges.


- Our Motivation:
 
Every member of our group has a love for gaming and since taking part in our fullstack bootcamp we wanted to try and apply our newly learned skills as web development to something we know and love.
   
- Why did we choose to build this?
  
Video Games have come such a long way.  Today they can be enormous, open-world, emersive, massively multiplayer and so graphically realistic.  We really wanted to prove to ourselves that we could make something simple in a very short amount of time but still have it be fun and interesting.  Also, we just got back from Christmas break and that had a lot to do with the inspiration behind our theme.

- What problem does it solve?

Boredom, fidgeting, something quick and fun to do when your free time is very limited.

- What did you learn?

1.) How to quickly get an app (front and back end communicating) up, running and deployed.

2.) How to take a problem and turn it into something attractive. ie. it takes some time to load from the start page 
to the cookie itself so we have a loading screen.

3.) How to apply what we learned throughout our fullstack bootcamp


## User Story

As a casual gamer, I want to be able to click on a cookie graphic to earn points so that I can gradually unlock new upgrades and features, keeping the gameplay engaging and rewarding.

I want the application to be responsive and accessible on various devices and screen sizes.

## Acceptance Criteria

Users are able to sign up, log in, and log out of the application securely.

The game should have a clickable "cookie" graphic that responds to user clicks.

Each click on the graphic should increment a points counter by a specified amount (e.g., 1 point per click).

The points counter should be visible on the game interface, providing feedback to the player.

There should be multiple upgrades or features that can be unlocked using points earned from clicks

The upgrades/features should enhance the gameplay experience, such as increasing the points per click, automating the clicks, or unlocking bonus points.

The game should have a clear progression system, showing players their current score, achievements, and the next unlockable feature.

The points and upgrades should persist between gaming sessions, allowing players to continue their progress over time.

The game should provide a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction as players unlock new upgrades and features.

The application has a responsive and polished UI.

The application is accessible on various devices and screen sizes.
